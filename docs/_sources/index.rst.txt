Welcome to the NHERI-SimCenter 2023 Programming Bootcamp
========================================================

Following the success of our online version of this workshop,
this year's **offering will be solely online**.  Expect to collaborate with 
students from across the globe and enjoy the oportunity to make new friends
at unexpected places.

**The format** will be two weeks of daily self-study assignments, followed by three (3) hours of
online lectures and exercises via zoom, followed by homework assignments and some more self-study 
video sessions. Every morning, office hours are held for one (1) hour before the actual meetings.

.. note::
   
   It is intense. While instruction is limited to 3 hours a day, expect to spend significant hours daily working and submitting assignments if you intend to get anything worthwhile from the courses.



These two weeks are offered as individual or as one combined workshop as follows.

1. C/C++/HPC Workshop 

   * **Mon June 5 - Friday, June 9, 2023**

   The first week of this bootcamp is all focused on HPC target environments,
   reviewing coding basiscs in C and C++, but quickly transitioning to the fundamentals of
   parallel programming.  This is a highly intensive crash course which introduces attendees to
   concepts of computing, and quickly goes through fundamentals of coding in C and C++ to build
   applications that run in parallel.



2. Python Workshop

   * **Mon June 12 - Friday, June 16, 2023**

   The Python workshop is geared towards beginner and intermediate level material.
   The first three days will cover and refresh basic concepts of python, 
   as well as fundamentals of code design.
   Thursday will transition you to command-line use of python, as you'll need on any 
   high-performance computing (HPC) environment. 
   The workship will conclude on Friday with a team coding challange that emphasizes on
   collaborative coding and computing.


.. note::

   Course material is available through
